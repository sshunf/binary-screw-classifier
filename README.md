# Binary Screw Classifier
Binary classifier to determine whether a screw is "good" or "defective." Uses ResNet 50 architecture with some tuning to achieve 95%+ accuracy on dataset. This project helped me learn more about convolutional neural networks and how to apply them to real world problems. 
## Dataset
The dataset used is the MVTec Screws dataset. This dataset includes screw samples labeled as "good" screws and "anomalous" screws and it is used for anomaly detection.
